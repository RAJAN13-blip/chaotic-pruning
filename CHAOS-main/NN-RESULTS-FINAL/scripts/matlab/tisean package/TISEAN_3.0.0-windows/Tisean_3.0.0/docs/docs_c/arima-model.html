<h1 align=center>Description of the program: <font color=Blue>arima-model
</font>
</h1>
<hr>
This program fits (by means of least squares) an autoregressive
integrated moving average
(ARIMA) model to the possibly
multivariate data. <br>
As a first step a AR model is fitted to give a first guess of the
residuals which enter the MA part. With these residuals the full ARIMA
is fitted. This fit is repeated until convergence of the residuals is
reached or a maximum number of iterations was performed.<br>
Note that no attempt has 
been made to generate a <em>stable</em> model.

<h2 align=center>Usage:</h2>
<center>
<font color=Red>arima-model [Options]</font>
<p>
Everything not being a valid option will be interpreted as a potential datafile name. Given no datafile at all, means read stdin. Also <font color=Red>-</font> means stdin
<p>
Possible options are:

<h2 align=center>Description of the Output:</h2>
If <font color=blue>P</font> is not given:<br>
The first line contains the forecast error averaged over all
components. The second line contains the average forecast errors for
all components individually. The third line contains the
Log-likelihood and the AIC values of the fit. The next <font
color=blue>p*m</font> lines contain the fitted ar coefficients and the
rest of the file are either the residuals of the fit or a simulated
new trajectory.
<p>
If <font color=blue>P</font> is given:<br>
The first lines (marked #iteration xxx) show the convergence of the
residuals of the ARIMA fit. The rest of the files is like in the above
case.
