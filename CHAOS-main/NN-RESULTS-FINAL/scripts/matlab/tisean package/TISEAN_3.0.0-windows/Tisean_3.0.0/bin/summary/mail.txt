I am currently in my prefinal year of undergraduate studies, pursuing Mathematics and Computer Science. My academic curriculum has been a major source of motivation for me to look forward to interdisciplinary studies and research. Applied mathematics is something that genuinely interests me, and through foundational research, I hope to improve the conceptual frameworks for describing and comprehending complex computational systems as well as the tools and development processes used for development.

Deep Learning is one such paradigm where I have spent over a year exploring the immense number of applications to now questioning its explainability. I started as an intern in a government research lab where we focused on blizzard modeling and predictions in the polar regions of the Earth. This is where I learned about deep learning models and their use in climate modeling. However, I couldn’t absorb the way Neural Networks worked around large collections of nonlinear data and even outperformed humans in most of the tasks. In the following few months after the internship, I got an opportunity to work on a project (which I’m currently working upon) where we aim to understand the working dynamics of Artificial Neural Networks from the perspective of Dynamical Systems and investigate elements of Chaos in it. From my coursework in college, I was thoroughly introduced to Ordinary Differential Equations and a very brief introduction to Dynamical systems and modeling, which was enough to get me started on this project and start exploring this new intersection of modern computer science and applied math. 

What I aspire to seek from this program is a handful of experience in such applications of applied mathematics and exploring theoretical side of Machine learning to have a broader perspective in analyzing complex systems. I also feel that this program will provide me with the right exposure and give an insight into a magnificent research culture. Working alongside students from different backgrounds and under researchers who have contributed immensely to their fields will bring me closer to understanding the research process and get an immense amount of guidance, which any aspiring researcher wouldn’t want to miss out on. I am sure that, in the right direction, I can use my capabilities. 
Looking forward to this opportunity.
